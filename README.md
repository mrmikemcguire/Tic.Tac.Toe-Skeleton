Tic.Tac.Toe-Skeleton
====================

This is a skeleton of a mostly-working blackjack game. It is meant as a scaffold for beginning Java programmers to modify and improve.
Possible changes could be:

Improve input validation (2 pts)

Have a coin flip determine who goes first (3 pts)

Improve computer player AI (1 pt for selecting the center if available, 3 pts for blocking a winning move)

Increase the size of the board and require four in a row to win (4 pts)

Refactor checkForWonGame() to be less than half as long (3 pts)
